# Re-Imagining Input: Beyond the Typewriter Keyboard
My undergraduate thesis on the theory of Brain-Computer Interfaces and building a new handheld input device for the advancing XR revolution to supersede the keyboard.

## Details 
Thesis submitted to the University of Edinburgh School of Informatics for the degree of BSc in Computational Cognitive Science 2022.[^1]

[^1]: Note that 1) the thesis has received minor updates since the original submission, and 2) it is not possible to compile the pdf perfectly from the `.tex` file alone as there are many missing files (it exists for git diffs, and for those who wish to contribute edits/commentary here). 

_Author_: Nathan Sharp  
_Supervisor_: Antonio Barbalace

## Abstract
> Here we present a novel work on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aka 'the augmentation of human intelligence with computers', with a focus on input devices.
> A thesis in three parts: I) Theory, II) Case Studies, and III) Practical.
> Part I lays out our novel worldview relating to BCI.
> Part II conducts case studies on existing, past and envisioned interface devices.
> Part III is a project to develop a new high-throughput and high-pervasiveness input device to 1) supersede the keyboard, and 2) be suitable for XR.
