> Building a new handheld input device for the advancing XR revolution to supersede the keyboard

<!-- **Thesis exploring the future of computer input. We develop theory, conduct case studies, then design and build a new input device to supersede the keyboard in the advancing XR revolution.** -->

## Abstract
> Here we present novel work on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aka 'the augmentation of human intelligence with computers', with a focus on input devices.
> A thesis in three parts: I) Theory, II) Case Studies, and III) Practical.
> Part I lays out our novel worldview relating to BCI.
> Part II conducts case studies on existing, past and envisioned interface devices.
> Part III is a project to develop a new high-throughput and high-pervasiveness input device to 1) supersede the keyboard, and 2) be suitable for XR.

## Details 
Thesis submitted to the University of Edinburgh, School of Informatics for the degree of BSc in Computational Cognitive Science 2022.
Note, this thesis has received minor updates since the original submission.  

_Author_: Nathan Sharp (nathansharp03@gmail.com)  
_Supervisor_: Antonio Barbalace

Note, it is not possible to compile the thesis pdf perfectly from the `.tex` file alone,  it is there for git diffs, and for those who may wish to contribute edits here.
