## Abstract
> Here we present novel work on Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aka 'the augmentation of human intelligence with computers', with a focus on input devices.
> A thesis in three parts: I) Theory, II) Case Studies, and III) Practical.
> Part I lays out our novel worldview relating to BCI.
> Part II conducts case studies on existing, past and envisioned interface devices.
> Part III is a project to develop a new high-throughput and high-pervasiveness input device to 1) supersede the keyboard, and 2) be suitable for XR.

## Details 
Thesis submitted to the University of Edinburgh School of Informatics for the degree of BSc in Computational Cognitive Science 2022.

_Author_: Nathan Sharp (nathansharp03@gmail.com)  
_Supervisor_: Antonio Barbalace

Note that 1) this thesis has received minor updates since the original submission, and 2) it is not possible to compile the pdf perfectly from the `.tex` file alone as there are many missing files: it exists for git diffs, and for those who may wish to contribute edits/commentary here. 
 
## Access 
1. Contribute publicly via adobe acrobat online: (link at top)
2. Download the pdf directly: [`thesis_reimagining-computer-input.pdf`](thesis_reimagining-computer-input.pdf) (then click `Download`)
3. (Expert/Brave) Make edits to the `.tex` file directly: [`thesis_reimagining-computer-input.tex`](thesis_reimagining-computer-input.tex)
