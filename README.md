## Abstract
<!-- push abstract changes to thesis --> 
> A novel theoretical and practical work on "the augmentation of human intelligence with computers" aka Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), with a focus on input devices.
> First, we formalise a new ’5AA’ framework for analysing the capacities of BCIs, which drives our historical narrative of BCI ’interface revolutions’ and supports our central claim: of being in the midst of a 5th fundamental revolution-- the XR revolution.
> We identify the ’Achillies heel of XR’, the absence of (anyone developing) a high-throughput, high-pervasiveness input device for XR.
> Second, we conduct cases studies on existing, past and envisioned interface devices, we classify the many shortcomings of the (typewriter) keyboard, both for XR and more generally.
> Finally, we begin an ongoing practical project to design and build a new Hand Controlled Input Device (HCID) to (1) better the typewriter keyboard (also mouse and touchscreen), and (2) be suitable for the XR revolution.
> We propose a new interface and implement it from scratch.
