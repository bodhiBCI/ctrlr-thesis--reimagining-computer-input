> Building a wearable Hand Controlled Input Device (HCID) for the advancing XR revolution.

**Thesis exploring the future of computer input. We study the theory, conduct case studies, then design and build a new input device for the advancing XR revolution.**

## Abstract
<!-- push abstract changes to thesis --> 
> A novel theoretical and practical work on 'the augmentation of human intelligence with computers' aka Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI); with a focus on input devices.
> First, we lay out our new ’5AA’ framework for analysing the capacities of BCIs.
> This induces our historical lens of studying BCI ’interface revolutions’ and leads to our central claim: of being in the midst of a 5th fundamental revolution-- the XR revolution.
> We go on to identify the ’Achillies heel of XR': the absence of development in a high-throughput, high-pervasiveness input modality for XR.
> Second, we conduct cases studies on existing, past and envisioned interface devices.
> In particular, we classify the many shortcomings of the (typewriter) keyboard, both for XR and more generally.
> Finally, we undertake an ongoing practical project to design and build a new Hand Controlled Input Device (HCID) to (1) better the typewriter keyboard (also mouse and touchscreen), and (2) be native to the coming XR revolution.
> We propose a new interface and implement it from scratch.
